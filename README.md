## Core Features

1. **Runtime Tool Creation**: The agent can dynamically create new Python tools at runtime by generating Python code, saving it to a file, importing it as a module, and registering its entrypoint function for later use. This allows the agent to adapt and extend its capabilities on the fly.
2. **Dynamic Tool Execution**: The agent can execute any registered tool dynamically by its name, passing arguments as needed. This enables the agent to utilize both pre-defined and newly created tools seamlessly within its workflow.
3. **Dependency Management**: The agent includes a tool to install Python packages within its virtual environment. This ensures that any new tools created or used by the agent can have their necessary dependencies met without manual intervention.
4. **ReAct Agent Loop**: The agent operates based on a ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) loop, where it follows a Thought → Action → Observation sequence. This structured approach guides the agent in problem-solving, tool creation, and tool usage.
5. **LLM Integration (LangChain)**: The agent leverages LangChain for integrating with Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically ChatOpenAI. This allows the agent to understand natural language prompts, reason about tasks, and generate appropriate actions, including tool creation and usage.
